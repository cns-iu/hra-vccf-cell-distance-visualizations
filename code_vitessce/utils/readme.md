## json_layout_customizer.py

The `json_layout_customizer.py` script is designed to automatically edit and enhance the default layout of Vitessce visualization JSON files within a specified directory and its subdirectories. By targeting the "spatial" component, the script adjusts its width and aligns other components accordingly, enabling a streamlined customization of Vitessce visualizations. This is particularly useful for bulk adjustments where manual editing can be cumbersome. The spatial width can be customized using the `spatial_width` parameter (default `10.0`).
